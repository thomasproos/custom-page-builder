# Custom Page Builder
Written by Thomas Roos

## Project Description
Arguably the most challenging and ambitious passion project I've undertaken. During my internship in the summer of 2024, I was introduced to the world of Read-to-go website makers like WordPress. My interest
in the way the website handled information and displayed web programming in such a simplified manner inspired me to figure out how it worked by making my own website creator. My custom page builder was challenging
not in the way it was necessarily programmed, but rather in how I had to tackle the logic regarding the multi-layered nature of how I was interested in storing this data. I ended up using a layered standardized format
that would require a confusing series of recursive React components that would feed into each other base on their nature. In addition to this problem, I was also faced with the realization that I wanted to present 
the website in 2 different mode: editing mode and viewing mode. I had to learn how to wrap containers in other React components that were capable of being moved, edited and interacted with, and then be easily removed when rebuilding
the website when the user wants to change to viewing mode.

While the previews don't really paint a full picture of the websites current capabilities, they serve purely for testing purposes while I continue making changes to the base infrastructure needed for
the project to work as a whole.
